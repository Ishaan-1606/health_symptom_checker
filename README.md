# Symptom Checker API ü©∫

An advanced, AI-driven backend service designed to provide intelligent medical symptom analysis. This API leverages Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash for multimodal input processing (text and images), offers location-aware recommendations for nearby healthcare facilities, and maintains a secure, persistent history of user queries.
